A single-page, one-column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The resume has six sections: education, experience, projects, achievements, skills and personaal information.

### Motivation

This template was created because the original author, Sourabh Bajah, found that most available templates either focus on two columns, or are multiple pages long. Two-column templates are hard to focus while multiple-page resumes are just too long to be used in career fairs.
